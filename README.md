# MTS hackathon

## Hackathon task:

MTS is a big tech russian company that owns streming service called KION. During the hackathon we were trying to solve this problem that KION had: how to make watching tv-shows more interesting?

Specifically, they were interested in the new trend called gamefication. This is when company adds some game element to their project, for example achievements.

Our solution was to add little games in the genre of visual novels to the site. We wanted this games to be about movies that are accesible on the KION's platform. The main point of games was to explore different scenarios in the beloved movie setting by yourself!

With this solution we managed to get prestigious third place in the event.

## Visual novel

In this project we have quick version of the product that we were presenting on the hackathon which is visual novel. 

The game showcase you can see in the file visual_novel_showcase.mkv

The game was written using the RenPy engine. File script.rpy contains main script for the visual novel.
